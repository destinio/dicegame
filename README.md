## Introduction

There are various use cases for a Random Number Generator. You could do a random dice roll or get a random quote. Most of the time, the implementation is relatively straightforward and similar to this project’s approach. In this project, we will create a dice roll simulation.

## Requirements

The RNG should consist of:

- An input box to assign how many dice to roll
- A drop down box to select the sides of the dice (for example d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20)
- function taking the inputs from the form
- An output to show # of dice rolled, the type of dice (d4, d6 ..), the total count of the dices rolled
- Output the details (number) of the individual dice rolls (Possibly using a foreach loop)
